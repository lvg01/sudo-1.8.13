For the article we used this binary version of Clang/LLVM 3.3:

  http://llvm.org/releases/3.3/clang+llvm-3.3-Ubuntu-13.04-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.bz2

You can double check that a given version of LLVM contains this bug by using the
bug.c program found in this directory:

  $ gcc -O1 bug.c && ./a.out
  no bug
  $ ~/clang+llvm-3.3-Ubuntu-13.04-x86_64-linux-gnu/bin/clang -O1 bug.c && ./a.out
  bug!

The file verify_patch.c can (we think) be used to show that the original and
patched sudo code are equivalent. Of course you should read it and see if you
believe us. Run the equivalence checker like this:

  cbmc verify-patch.c --function compare

The last line of output should be "VERIFICATION SUCCESSFUL". You can get CBMC
